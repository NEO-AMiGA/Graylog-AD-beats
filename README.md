This content pack was built as a method to make sure IT was aware of changes happinging in Active Directory and as a basic framework for monitoring some Windows Security Issues.  It is incomplete for security monitoring as it relies only on what is kicked out in Windows standard logs... so don't rely on it for that... feel free to upgrade it though.

NOTE:   THere are installation caveats that will cause you problems if you don't look into them.
